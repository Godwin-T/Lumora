## Overview

The Lumora V2 client is a modern web application built to provide an interactive and responsive interface for users. It communicates with the backend to fetch and display data, handle authentication, and manage user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript** (if applicable): For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Redux / Context API**: For state management.
- **Axios / Fetch API**: For HTTP requests.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **Styled Components / CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Jest / React Testing Library**: For testing components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/fresh/Documents/Workflow/Projects/lumora_v2/client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

```
The app will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

- `start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production.
- `test`: Runs tests.
- `lint`: Lints the codebase.

## Environment Variables

```

## API Integration

All API requests are handled via the `services/` directory. Update the base URL in the environment variables as needed.
